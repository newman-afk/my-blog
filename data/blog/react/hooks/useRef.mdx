`useRef` is a React Hook that lets you reference a value thatâ€™s not needed for rendering.

```jsx
const ref = useRef(initialValue)
```

## Pitfall

Do not write or read ref.current during rendering.

React expects that the body of your component behaves like a pure function:

- If the inputs (props, state, and context) are the same, it should return exactly the same JSX.
- Calling it in a different order or with different arguments should not affect the results of other calls.

Reading or writing a ref during rendering breaks these expectations.

```jsx
function MyComponent() {
  // ...
  // ðŸš© Don't write a ref during rendering
  myRef.current = 123
  // ...
  // ðŸš© Don't read a ref during rendering
  return <h1>{myOtherRef.current}</h1>
}
```

You can read or write refs from event handlers or effects instead.

```jsx
function MyComponent() {
  // ...
  useEffect(() => {
    // âœ… You can read or write refs in effects
    myRef.current = 123
  })
  // ...
  function handleClick() {
    // âœ… You can read or write refs in event handlers
    doSomething(myOtherRef.current)
  }
  // ...
}
```

If you have to read or write something during rendering, use state instead.

When you break these rules, your component might still work, but most of the newer features weâ€™re adding to React will rely on these expectations. Read more about keeping your components pure.

## Avoiding recreating the ref contents

React saves the initial ref value once and ignores it on the next renders.

```jsx
function Video() {
  const playerRef = useRef(new VideoPlayer())
  // ...
}
```

Although the result of `new VideoPlayer()` is only used for the initial render, youâ€™re still calling this function on every render. This can be wasteful if itâ€™s creating expensive objects.

To solve it, you may initialize the ref like this instead:

```jsx
function Video() {
  const playerRef = useRef(null)
  if (playerRef.current === null) {
    playerRef.current = new VideoPlayer()
  }
  // ...
}
```

Normally, writing or reading `ref.current` during render is not allowed. However, itâ€™s fine in this case because the result is always the same, and the condition only executes during initialization so itâ€™s fully predictable.

```jsx
import { forwardRef } from 'react';

const MyInput = forwardRef(({ value, onChange }, ref) => {
  return (
    <input
      value={value}
      onChange={onChange}
      ref={ref}
    />
  );
});

export default MyInput;
```

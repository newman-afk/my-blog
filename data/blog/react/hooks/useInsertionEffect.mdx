`useInsertionEffect` is for CSS-in-JS library authors. Unless you are working on a CSS-in-JS library and need a place to inject the styles, you probably want `useEffect` or `useLayoutEffect` instead.

`useInsertionEffect` is a version of `useEffect` that fires before any DOM mutations.

```jsx
useInsertionEffect(setup, dependencies?)
```

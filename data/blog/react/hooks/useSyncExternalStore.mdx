`useSyncExternalStore` is a React Hook that lets you subscribe to an external store.

```jsx
const snapshot = useSyncExternalStore(subscribe, getSnapshot, getServerSnapshot?)
```

## Note

When possible, we recommend using built-in React state with `useState` and `useReducer` instead. The `useSyncExternalStore` API is mostly useful if you need to integrate with existing non-React code.

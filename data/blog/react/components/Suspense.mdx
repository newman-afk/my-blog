`<Suspense>` lets you display a fallback until its children have finished loading.

```jsx
<Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>
  <SomeComponent />
</Suspense>
```

## 适用场景

- Data fetching with Suspense-enabled frameworks like `Relay` and `Next.js`
- Lazy-loading component code with `lazy`
- State management packages such as `Redux`、`SWR`、`React Query` etc.

Suspense 处理 fetch data 尚不支持在 React 中使用, 如果一定要，请使用上述所示的状态管理工具，具体操作见其文档(均不推荐且如使用须自行确保兼容性)，并确保配合使用[react-error-boundary](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-error-boundary)

## 进阶

如果希望 fallback 只在最初加载时显示，可以使用 `useDeferredValue` 、 `useTransition`或`startTransition`, 注意，`startTransition` 可视为 `useTransition` 的一部分，但 `startTransition` 可在 `function component` 之外使用.

官方描述：Both deferred values and transitions let you avoid showing Suspense fallback in favor of inline indicators. Transitions mark the whole update as non-urgent so they are typically used by frameworks and router libraries for navigation. Deferred values, on the other hand, are mostly useful in application code where you want to mark a part of UI as non-urgent and let it “lag behind” the rest of the UI.

## Resetting Suspense boundaries on navigation

注意：Suspense-enabled routers are expected to wrap the navigation updates into transitions by default.

During a transition, React will avoid hiding already revealed content. However, if you navigate to a route with different parameters, you might want to tell React it is different content. You can express this with a `key`:

```jsx
<ProfilePage key={queryParams.id} />
```

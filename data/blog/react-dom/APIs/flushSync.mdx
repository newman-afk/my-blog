## Flushing updates for third-party integrations

When integrating with third-party code such as browser APIs or UI libraries, it may be necessary to force React to flush updates. Use `flushSync` to force React to flush any `state updates` inside the callback synchronously:

```jsx
flushSync(() => {
  setSomething(123)
})
// By this line, the DOM is updated.
```

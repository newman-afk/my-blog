`hydrateRoot` lets you display React components inside a browser DOM node whose HTML content was previously generated by `react-dom/server`.

```jsx
import './styles.css'
import { hydrateRoot } from 'react-dom/client'
import App from './App.js'

hydrateRoot(document.getElementById('root'), <App />)
```

## Suppressing unavoidable hydration mismatch errors

```jsx
export default function App() {
  return <h1 suppressHydrationWarning={true}>Current Date: {new Date().toLocaleDateString()}</h1>
}
```

This only works one level deep, and is intended to be an escape hatch. Don’t overuse it. Unless it’s text content, React still won’t attempt to patch it up, so it may remain inconsistent until future updates.
